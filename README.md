### About

Buckaroo is the Payment Service Provider for all your online payments with more than 15,000 companies relying on Buckaroo's platform to securely process their payments, subscriptions and unpaid
invoices. Buckaroo developed their own Node SDK. The SDK is a modern, open-source Node.js library that makes it easy to integrate your Javascript application with Buckaroo's services. Start accepting
payments today with Buckaroo.

### Requirements

To use the Buckaroo API client, the following things are required:

- A Buckaroo account ([Dutch](https://www.buckaroo.nl/start) or [English](https://www.buckaroo.eu/solutions/request-form))
- Node.js 6.14.Ã— or greater

### Installation

```bash
npm install @buckaroo/buckaroo_sdk
```

### Example

Initiate the buckaroo client with your website key and secret key. The keys can be retrieved from your [Buckaroo account](https://plaza.buckaroo.nl/Login).

```javascript
import Buckaroo from '@buckaroo/buckaroo_sdk';

const buckarooClient = Buckaroo.InitializeClient(
    {
        secretKey: 'KEY',
        websiteKey: 'SECRET',
    },
    {
        mode: 'TEST', // OR 'LIVE'
        currency: 'EUR',
        returnURL: 'RETURN_URL',
        pushURL: 'PUSH_URL',
    }
)
```

Create a payment with all the available payment methods. In this example, we show how to create a credit card payment. Each payment has a slightly different payload.

```javascript
const payment = await buckarooClient
    .method('mastercard')
    .pay({
        amountDebit: 100,
    })
    .request();
```

After you create a transaction, you can retrieve several transaction information on demand.

```javascript
const transaction = buckarooClient.transaction(payment.getTransactionKey());

await transaction.status(); // Retrieve transaction status
await transaction.refundInfo(); // Retrieve refund info
await transaction.cancelInfo(); // Retrieve cancellation info
```

### Regarding Usage Outside of Node.js
This library is written in JavaScript, a versatile programming language with broad applicability. While it's technically possible to integrate this library into a website or mobile application, it's strongly advised against doing so.

In the standard configuration, you make requests to the Buckaroo API using one of our provided libraries, typically from your server (such as a Node.js server). Your secret key is securely stored on this server, inaccessible to external entities.

However, if you incorporate this library directly into a website or app, your secret key will be exposed to users. This could enable users to take actions on your behalf using that key.
